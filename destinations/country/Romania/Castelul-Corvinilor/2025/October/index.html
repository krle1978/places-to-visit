        <h1>Castelul Corvinilor: A Gothic Masterpiece Standing Over Time</h1>
        <p class="city-meta-date">Visited in October 2025 • Best season: Autumn</p>
        <p class="city-meta-intro">
            Castelul Corvinilor is one of the most beautiful medieval castles in Europe.
            Combined with the autumn colors, fog and silence of Hunedoara,
            the castle looks like you've stepped into the strange side of some old legend.

<!-- WHAT I EXPERIENCED -->
<section class="city-section">
    <h2>What I Experienced</h2>
    <p>
        When you first see Castelul Corvinilor, from a distance it looks like a set piece —
        too perfect, too big, too “movie-like” to be real.
        The tall towers, the bridge over the ravine, the dark stone and copper roofs that shimmer
        in the sunlight — everything seems as if time has stood still.
    </p>

    <p>
        In October, with the cooler air and autumn light, the whole atmosphere becomes 
        even more dramatic. There are tourists, but not too many, so you can enjoy the 
        silence of the walls and the details of the 15th-century architecture.

            When you reach the visitor parking lot, only the upper tip of Corvin Castle’s 
            main tower peeks above the hill, hinting at the direction of your medieval adventure. 
            Once you pass through the outer gate, the entire fortress suddenly opens before you 
            in full Transylvanian grandeur, instantly capturing your attention. Crossing the 
            long wooden bridge leads you into the courtyard, a space enclosed by towers and 
            buildings of different shapes and heights, giving the feeling that you’ve stepped 
            into a living medieval town.<br><br>

            Inside the castle, narrow passageways alternate with spacious halls, each revealing 
            a different corner of its history. Steep, winding staircases take you up the towers, 
            where sweeping views of surrounding hills and villages unfold. One tower contains 
            the bust of Sibinjan Janko and the small chamber where he was once held prisoner. 
            As you explore further, you encounter a series of eerie 3D “ghost” displays that 
            seem ready to leap from their frames.<br><br>

            Eventually you enter the King’s Hall, marked by tall columns and graceful arches, 
            with knight armor displayed along the walls to enhance the medieval atmosphere. 
            And just when you think the journey is over, exiting the castle leads you to a 
            torture museum — a chilling final touch that adds to the dark mystique of 
            Corvin Castle.<br><br>
