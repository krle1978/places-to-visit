        <h1>Castelul Corvinilor: A Gothic Masterpiece Standing Over Time</h1>
        <p class="city-meta-date">Visited in October 2025 • Best season: Autumn</p>
        <p class="city-meta-intro">
            Castelul Corvinilor is one of the most beautiful medieval castles in Europe.
            Combined with the autumn colors, fog and silence of Hunedoara,
            the castle looks like you've stepped into the strange side of some old legend.

<!-- WHAT I EXPERIENCED -->
<section class="city-section">
    <h2>What I Experienced</h2>
    <p>
        When you first see Castelul Corvinilor, from a distance it looks like a set piece —
        too perfect, too big, too “movie-like” to be real.
        The tall towers, the bridge over the ravine, the dark stone and copper roofs that shimmer
        in the sunlight — everything seems as if time has stood still.
    </p>

    <p>
        In October, with the cooler air and autumn light, the whole atmosphere becomes 
        even more dramatic. There are tourists, but not too many, so you can enjoy the 
        silence of the walls and the details of the 15th-century architecture.
