        <p class="city-meta-intro">
            Cluj-Napoca is Romania’s cultural and academic heart — a lively, youthful city
            full of cafes, parks, art, and a vibrant atmosphere. October adds golden colors
            to the historic center, making it perfect for exploring on foot.

<!-- WHAT I EXPERIENCED -->
<section class="city-section">
    <h2>What I Experienced</h2>

    <p>
        Cluj-Napoca feels alive from the moment you arrive. Students everywhere,
        art on every corner, historic squares filled with outdoor terraces, and
        the calm, wide parks that cut through the city.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unirii Square is the heart of everything — with its huge cathedral, cafés,
        and the Matthias Corvinus statue standing proudly in the center.
        In October, the light is warm, the air is crisp, and the whole city feels photogenic.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even though Cluj is modern and energetic, it’s also incredibly walkable, safe,
        and charming — a perfect blend of youth and history.

                <p>
                    Union Square (Piața Unirii) is the largest and most important square in Cluj-Napoca, 
                    serving as the central point from which the historic district extends. <br>
                    It features major landmarks such as St. Michael’s Church—the tallest church tower 
                    in Romania—along with the Matthias Corvinus statue, the old town hall, the National 
                    Museum of Art, and several historic palaces. Historically known as “Big Market Square,” <br>
                    it was distinguished from the smaller “Little Market Square,” now called Museum Square.

                <h3>Lucian Blaga National Theatre</h3>
                <p>The theatre building, located in Cluj-Napoca in Romania, was constructed between 1904 and 1906 in a neo-Baroque 
                    style and designed by Austrian architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer.
                    It opened on 8 September 1906, and has a seating capacity of 928.<br>
                    Initially serving the Hungarian National Theatre until 1919, after which it became home to

                    The building is listed in Romania’s National Register of Historic Monuments and continues 
                    to host both classical and modern dramatic productions.</p>

                    most important religious landmarks and is dedicated to the Dormition 
                    of the Mother of God. It became an archiepiscopal cathedral in 1973
                    and, since 2006, has served as the cathedral of the Archdiocese of 
                    Vad, Feleac, and Cluj, as well as the seat of the Cluj, Maramureș, 
                    and Sălaj Metropolis. Today, it is Romania’s third-tallest cathedral

                    After your museum visit, step into one of the excellent local eateries like Roata, which 
                    specialises in traditional Romanian cuisine—think sarmale (stuffed cabbage rolls) and papanăşi 
                    (Romanian doughnuts) in a cosy, atmospheric setting. <br>
                    Whether you’re lingering over a good meal or wandering cobbled streets, 
                    the Old Town makes it easy to combine culture and cuisine in one wander-worthy spot.

            Cluj is a beautiful city that resembles the cities of Central Europe. 
            Some streets and facades in the old part of the city resemble those of Vienna. 
            I enjoyed walking through the city and the park that is on a hill and from where 
            you can see the whole city. And it is not far from the center<br> 
            My companion and I arrived around 4 pm. We passed by the National Theater and 
            headed towards the city center. Along the way, we came across the monument to 
            the mother wolf who raised Romulus and Remus. In the center is the monument to 
            Meteia and the Roman Catholic church. We walked through the streets of the old 
            part of the city. We enjoyed the architecture and the beautifully decorated 
            gardens of restaurants with lamps.<br> 
            We looked for a place to sit down and eat something nice. And then 'Berliner 
            Kebab' caught my eye. I remembered that I had the most beautiful wrap in Vienna, 
            right at the 'Berliner Döner' stand in Vienna. We entered that restaurant, 
            and we didn't regret it.<br> 
            On the way to the viewpoint, I came across the cafe 'Nish', which was closed 
            because it was Sunday. And we came to the hill where 'Cetățuia Park' is located. 
            From there, the view extends over the entire city of Cluj-Napoca.<br> 
            On the way back, we stopped by the Orthodox Church, which is across from the 
            National Theater. They are separated by a park with stands selling handicrafts 
            and jewelry.
