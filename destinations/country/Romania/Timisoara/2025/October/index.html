            Timisoara in October ima onu prijatnu kombinaciju — dovoljno života da ne deluje prazno, 
            ali bez gužve. Danju parkovi i trgovi, uveče svetla, kafe i tiha energija 
            grada koji ne pokušava da te impresionira na silu, nego polako.

<!-- WHAT I EXPERIENCED -->
<section class="city-section">
    <h2>What I Experienced</h2>
    <p>
        I arrived in Timisoara early in the morning, just as the city was starting to wake
         up. The main square, Victory Square, was empty of people, so I was free to walk around the 
         square and admire the baroque and art nouveau facades of the buildings on the square, 
         and the fairytale-like cathedral at the very end of the square.
    </p>
    <p>
        The city seems familiar if you're used to Central European cities: Art Nouveau facades, wide streets, 
        squares that open into each other. But it also has its own color – something in the pace of the people and 
        how relaxed they sit in cafes as the day fades.

<!-- WHY THIS PLACE IS SPECIAL -->
<section class="city-section">
    <h2>Why Timisoara is Special</h2>

    <div class="info-grid">
        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Austro-Hungarian Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                The facades around the main squares bear the hallmarks of Habsburg architecture – colorful, ornate, 
                with details worth slowing down to notice. It doesn't look like classic "Eastern Europe," 
                but more like a mix of Vienna and a small town in Hungary.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Squares that Feel Like Living Rooms</h3>
            <p>
               The squares here function as the living rooms of the city. People simply sit, 
                watch passersby, feed pigeons, talk. It's not a "tourist performance" – 
                it's their normal life.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-card">
            <h3>Parks and Greenery</h3>
            <p>
                There is a lot of greenery along the Bega Canal and through the city. In October, the trees take on 
                all shades of yellow and orange, which adds an extra layer to the atmosphere – especially in the afternoon 
                when the light hits them at an angle.

                <h3>Victory Square (Piața Victoriei)</h3>
                <p>
                   The main city square – wide, lively, but not chaotic. Ideal for a first walk through the city,
                    sitting in a cafe and people watching. In the evening, the bright facades and cathedrals create
                    a warm atmosphere.

                <h3>Serbian Orthodox Church</h3>
                <p>
                    Visible from Freedom Square, but the entrance is on the opposite side due to the Orthodox custom
                    that the altar faces east. The interior is quiet, warm and full of details — a perfect contrast
                    to the city noise.

                <p>
                    The most photogenic square in the city: pastel facades, baroque and art nouveau elements,
                    large open spaces. In October, the atmosphere is quieter and ideal for photography.

                    Less a tourist square, more a local one. Baroque-Gothic column in the center, facade lights
                    and during the year numerous events with food and drink stands.

<!-- BEST TIME TO VISIT -->
<section class="city-section">
    <h2>Best Time to Visit Timisoara</h2>
    <p>
        You can visit Timisoara all year round, but each season has its own character. 
        Here's how I would sum it up:
    </p>

    <div class="seasons-grid-city">
        <div class="season-box">
            <h3>Spring (March–May)</h3>
            <p>
                Spring brings pleasant temperatures, blooming parks, and ideal walking conditions. 
                If you like to see the city “awake but not crowded,” spring is a great choice.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="season-box">
            <h3>Summer (June–August)</h3>
            <p>
                Warmer, more events, longer days. More people on the streets, cafe gardens are full. 
                If you don't mind the heat, summer gives the most urban pulse.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="season-box">
            <h3>Autumn (September–November)</h3>
            <p>
                My recommendation. Golden tones in the parks, mild temperatures, less crowds in the center. 
                The squares and facades look even better in the soft autumn light.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="season-box">
            <h3>Winter (December–February)</h3>
            <p>
                Colder, but with the potential for New Year's and Christmas decorations. If you like winter cities, 
                it can be very pleasant - just expect shorter days and a slightly more closed-off vibe.
            </p>
