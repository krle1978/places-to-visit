        <h1>About Places To Visit</h1>
        <p>
            Places To Visit is a travel project where I combine photography, storytelling, 
            architecture, culture and seasonal recommendations — showing destinations through 
            the eyes of someone who truly explored them.

    <p style="max-width: 750px; font-size: 1.05rem; color: #4b5563; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        I love traveling, observing people, walking through old cities, exploring architecture and 
        understanding the culture behind every corner. Over time, I realized that my journeys 
        were more than just trips — they were collections of stories, moments, and insights.
        <br><br>
        This website was born to document those experiences, and more importantly — to help others 
        discover places in a meaningful and practical way. Not only “what to see”, but also 
        “when to visit”, “how it feels”, and “what makes the place special”.
